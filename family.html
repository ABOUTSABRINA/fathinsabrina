        <h2>Family Information</h2>
        </center>
       <p>Family.Family played a very important role in shaping who I am today.  In this day and age, to educate a child to be a "human being" is very difficult.  With their very strict upbringing, they were able to shape who I am now.  My parents are very strict in any matter.  Even going out of the house or doing anything.  The education and knowledge they imparted to me and my siblings is very valuable and useful.  Without them, I would not be here today. I am blessed to have a loving family that has always supported me in all aspects of my life. Here's a little about them:</p>
        
        <div class="family-container">
            <div class="family-card">
                <img src="father1.jpg" alt="Father">
                <h3>My Father</h3>
                <p>This is my father, a figure who does not know what it means to be tired in order to give the best for us as a family.  My father is a businessman.   My father is a very hard worker, no matter what the situation, he will do his best for the future of our family.   Despite his many ups and downs, he will still try to give the best to us as a family.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="family-card">
                <img src="mader1.jpg" alt="Mother">
                <h3>My Mother</h3>
                <p>Next is my mother.  A very strong figure.  Without my mother's prayers, I would not have been able to stay strong to face all the tests that came.  My mother is a teacher.  No matter where he is, he likes something that can benefit himself and others.  Although my mother is fierce, she is still a patient and loving person because she patiently educates us. She is the best supporters.</p>

            <div class="family-card">
                <img src="fatin.jpg" alt="Sibling 1">
                <h3>Fatin Zaharah</h3>
                <p>FMy sister.  My sister is a degree student who is continuing her studies at UMK, she is a very great and strong eldest child.  He is not a weak person but a very fierce and determined person.  But in his fierceness and strictness, there is a soft side that loves his younger brother very much.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="family-card">
                <img src="husna.jpg" alt="Sibling 3">
                <h3>Fatin Batrisya</h3>
                <p>Next is my younger sister.  She is an independent sister, happy go lucky and sometimes can be a very emotional person.  If he is not there, who else should I give instructions to help me pick up the TV remote.  He is a very spoiled person.  Hopefully he will be able to face the adult world with perseverance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="family-card">

                <h3>Mishary Rashid</h3>
                <p>Lastly, my youngest brother.  He is a very spoiled younger brother and a very active person in football involvement.  He is a representative of the school that competes at the state level and will compete at the national level.  He is a younger brother who likes to spend his older sister money.</p>
