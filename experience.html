        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>I have gained valuable experience through various part-time jobs. Among them at the factory canteen (Venture), being a kindergarten teacher at Al Baghdadi Kindergarten and Pusat Tuisyen Cemerlang. And recently, I completed an industrial internship at Miragold in the Human Resources and administration department.

                <h3>PART TIME CREW | VENTURE CANTEEN 
                    (Mac untill Jun 2020)</h3>
                <p>I used to work as a part-time employee at the canteen of Kilang Venture, Kempas, for 3 and a half months during the first phase of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in 2020. I worked in the evening until the night after finishing online classes, to balance academic and work commitments. While working there, I was responsible for assisting in the preparation of food and drinks, ensuring the canteen area was always clean and orderly, as well as providing friendly service to customers, including factory workers on duty. This experience taught me many things that matured me. Among them, time management, money storage, teamwork, and the importance of good communication in ensuring smooth operations. I work not because my family can't afford it but I work because I want to fill my free time.</p>

                <h3>PART TIME CREW | TADIKA AL BAGHDADI | PUSAT TUISYEN CEMERLANG
                     (April untill September 2022)</h3>
                <p>After finishing SPM in March 2022 (SPM 2021), I took the opportunity to work part-time in two places in different periods. From morning to evening, I work as a Part-time Teacher at Al Baghdadi Kindergarten from April to August 2022. In this kindergarten, I am responsible for teaching children aged 4 to 5 years old to read, while helping to form the basis of their learning with an interactive approach and fun

In addition, in the evenings, I work part-time online as a Tutor at the Excellent Tuition Center from May to September 2022. My job is to teach 8 to 9-year-old children in the subject of Mathematics, focusing on intensive practice and help them understand the basic concepts of mathematics effectively.

This experience gave me the opportunity to know the meaning of high patience, build communication skills, time management, and effective teaching techniques, in addition to strengthening my ability to handle various ages and learning styles.</p>

                <h3>INTERNSHIP (July untill September 2024)</h3>
                <p>During semester 4, my batch mates and I underwent industrial training from July to September. While interning at Miragold, I was given the opportunity to get to know the work environment in the HR department. Among my duties during the internship was to find potential employees, count and monitor weekly attendance punch cards, as well as manage suppliers for the second branch in KL. I also need to get involved in all the meetings that are organized and I also need to manage documents such as receipts and invoices and other important documents that can be used as evidence.

                    In addition, I assist in the preparation of the company's launch event, including finding venues, sponsors, and inviting artists and influencers. I was asked to extend my internship until the launching ceremony was over because I had understood the whole process. This experience taught me many aspects of management and administrative tasks.</p>
